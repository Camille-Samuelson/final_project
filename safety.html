            <h3>We’re in this together.</h3> 
            <h4>At Tribe, when we say that, we recognize that safety is a factor for the people seeking care for their loved ones, and for those who are offering care. So when we think about safety, we’re thinking about how each of us comes together to limit hurt, injury, and loss, and how we create environments where everyone has the opportunity to thrive.</h4>

        <h3>For Households</h3>
        <p>Children, elders, pets–-you put their safety first. We do too.</p> 

        <p>Tribe vets each caretaker, conducting criminal background checks and sex offender registry searches, and takes into account reviews from verified users, because there’s safety, and then there’s also comfort. In cases where transportation will be provided, we pay attention to traffic infractions and accidents, and require caregivers provide documentation of registration, inspection, and insurance.</p>
    
        <p>Safety isn’t just in who is a part of the tribe. It’s how we care for one another. Care providers put infants on their backs to sleep. They ensure children use safety equipment like helmets when riding scooters or bicycles. They provide extra hands and support for unstable walkers–young, old and in-between. Age-appropriate car safety restraints are in use whenever a charge is put into a vehicle. We encourage families to provide this equipment, but it is also available to our care providers for loan. Anyone can purchase through our store.</p>

            <h3>For Caregivers</h3>
            <p>Your compassion as a caretaker puts you in a vulnerable position.Other care directories neglect to acknowledge that safety  is a concern for caregivers as much as it is for careseekers. You are going into someone's home, caring for a child or an adult, a pet. Tribe understands that you're part of the "village," and the village works because we all take care of one another.</p>
