        <h3>Safety</h3>
        <p>Your loved one's safety is our highest priority. To make sure they are always protected during our care, we screen our caretakers with the strictest regulations. The best and brightest are who we want in our Tribe to care for yours. We train our team members through the Tribe training facilities to have all the skills they need to handle any situation. And through our in-house review system, you can hear other Tribe members' opinions about our caretakers. This enables you to find the best fit to care for your loved ones.</p>
